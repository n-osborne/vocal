# Vocal

**Disclamer:** This project is still experimental. No support will be provided
at this point, and its interface is still unstable.

Vocal is a set of OCaml modules, formally verified using
[Gospel](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/gospel) and its
[Why3](https://why3.lri.fr)
[plugin](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/why3gospel).
